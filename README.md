This repository contains the java project I did since the beginning

The most importan file her is inside javaFXprj - ther I created a menu which doesn`t exist in web. I had to mix two source to create a credible one unique menu 
The problem on the web, they tell you how to make menu buttons but they don`t tell that the screen in javafx is divided in 5 region.

The top region is where we place the menu using borderPane.setTop . 

The mid region is where we place all the content using borderPane.setCenter .
